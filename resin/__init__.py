"""
Welcome to the Resin Python SDK documentation.
This document aims to describe all the functions supported by the SDK, as well as
showing examples of their expected usage.

Install the Resin SDK:

From Pip:
```
pip install resin-sdk
```

From Source (In case, you want to test a development branch):
```
https://github.com/resin-io/resin-sdk-python
```

Getting started:

```python
>>> from resin import Resin
>>> resin = Resin()
>>> credentials = {'username':<your email>, 'password':<your password>}
>>> resin.auth.login(**credentials)
...
```

If you feel something is missing, not clear or could be improved, [please don't
hesitate to open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-sdk-python/issues), we'll be happy to help.
