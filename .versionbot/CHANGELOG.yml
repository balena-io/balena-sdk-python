    - subject: Add Python 3 support.
- commits:
    - body: >-
        This PR contains some changes to make sure the right libraries and

        dependencies are loaded for Python 3. There is no big change in the source code since most of the code is Python 3 compatible.

        Apart from that there are some improments and bug fixes included:

        - Implement base class for resin exceptions.

        - Fix a bug in `resin.models.device.get_all_by_application()` to make it

        works with API v3.
